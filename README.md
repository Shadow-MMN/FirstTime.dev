## 💡 Why This Project?

Contributing to open source can be challenging — not because of the code itself, but because finding the right issue to start with isn’t always easy.

GitHub’s native search system doesn’t always favor contributors who want to filter issues by beginner-friendly tags like **“good first issue”**, **“entry-level”**, or **“enhancement”**. Many developers, especially newcomers, get overwhelmed trying to find where to begin.

**FirstTime.Dev** solves this problem by providing a focused, contributor-friendly interface where you can:

- 🔍 **Search** for GitHub issues across multiple repositories  
- 🎯 **Filter** issues based on difficulty (*Good First Issue, Medium, Hard, Enhancement, etc.*)  
- 🧭 **Explore** opportunities to contribute to open-source projects that align with your interests

## 🚀 Goal

The goal of **FirstTime.Dev** is to create a platform that:

- Helps developers discover **issues suited to their level**  
- Encourages more people to **get involved in open source**  
- Reduces the frustration of **searching endlessly** for beginner-friendly issues  

We hope that **FirstTime.Dev** becomes a tool that bridges the gap between curious developers and open-source projects that need contributions.

## 🌍 Vision

To build a global community where **every developer’s first open-source contribution** starts with confidence — powered by **FirstTime.Dev**.
